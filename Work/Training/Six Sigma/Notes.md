# Overview

I should be focused on Green Belt and Black Belt.

To get Black Belt I'll need to discuss with Angshu exactly what would help me qualify, may also need to discuss with greater marvell.

I suspect I have completed projects that would qualify me for the Black Belt, Link Scale may be the first however.

I will plan on completing the Green Belt and finishing the quiz.
