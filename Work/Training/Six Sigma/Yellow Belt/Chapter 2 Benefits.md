# Chapter 2: How Six Sigma Benefits Organizations

Project by Project Improvement approach.

Project is tied to organizational strategy. Do not make improvement on everything, need to select a problem tied to your organizational strategy. Focus is #Customer #Focused and #Profits. Project #Benefits should be tied to the #Bottom-Line.

Project should be related to:
1. Customer Satisfaction
2. Defect Reduction
3. Making a process faster

must be tied to the financial numbers. It should connect improvement back to the financial numbers, this is what #Management understands.

Different tiers of "Belts" #SixSigmaYellowBelts and #SixSigmaGreenBelts should be looking for process improvement on a part time basis, but there are not rigurous requirements put on them. The #SixSigmaBlackBelts on the other hand may have more rigorous requirements on them on an ongoing basis and should be considered a full-time effort for them, continuously looking for ways to improve processes. 

#SixSigmaYellowBelts involved in project, but not leading.  Support Green and Black Belts
#SixSigmaGreenBelts lead small project
#SixSigmaBlackBelts lead organizational level projects

Notes:
 - Work I did with TTR is measurable and could be used to help qualify for a Black Belt
 - Ongoing effort for EzData and QA improvement could help qualify
 - LinkScale effort for improving our process could help qualify
 - Introducing GIT and ensuring it gains adoption could help qualify

The #SixSigma system helps generate sustained success inherently.
