# Test Patterns

# Firmware Architecture

# How to provide Algorithms (document vs sample code)

1. Prefer document and sample code
    1. wherever possible would prefer "flat scripts" that can be vectorized
    2. logic cannot be vectorized, simple match loops (watch for bit) can be vectorized
2. Need a pipe cleaner simple example as early as possible
3. Should work together to verify timing diagrams from ATE via offline code

# When will we get deliveries

1. Good and repeatably passing scripts / documents
2. Pipe Cleaner / first hand off
3. Register interaction example
4. Scope / Logic Analyzer capture of JTAG/I3C
5. Sample STIL for JTAG/I3C scratch write and scratch verify pattern (with documentation)
6. what language will be used

# How will we do correlation against your bench

1. ship parts to you
2. ship parts back etc...?
3. how much time should we allocate per step (shipping, correlation, ...)
