# Test Patterns

# Firmware Architecture

# How to provide Algorithms (document vs sample code)
1. Prefer document and sample code
2. Need a pipe cleaner simple example as early as possible

# When will we get deliveries
1. Pipe Cleaner / first hand off
2. Register interaction example
3. Scope / Logic Analyzer capture of JTAG/I3C
4. Sample STIL for JTAG/I3C scratch write and scratch verify pattern (with documentation)
