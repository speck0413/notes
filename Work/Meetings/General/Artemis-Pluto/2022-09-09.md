## Slides

- need CPU Subsystem RAM size and Memory Scheduler Memory Banks
- BUS can run at 12.5MHz
- JTAG (max 50MHz)
- UART (max 115,200)
- Backchannel: Backend I3C (max 12.5MHz)
- Firmware initialization / calibrations
    - Expect <6s for RX
    - TX IQ Cal 20s+, subject to optimizations
        - talking in and out of the chip
- Analog (ADC/DAC)
    - Has tone generation and memory
    - Can we loopback digital side
        - No it's either RX or TX
- RX to TX RFPLL Switch time
    - switch between RX/TX switching time must be <50uS
- ADC -- 8bits
- DAC -- 7bits


### More information required
- What is JTAG frame format for reading/writing (8-bits, 32-bits, N-bits?), hopefully auto-increment available
    - what are max and minimum shift size
    - Can we use JTAG in place of I3C for firmware communication
- What is JTAG max detection rate, can we push spec if we alter detection threshold
    - presently assuming 50MHz, should have minimum 4x throughput increase relative to I3C
- What is maximum memory size
    - CPU memory size (max allowed for firmware)
    - ADC / DAC memory sizes (max)
