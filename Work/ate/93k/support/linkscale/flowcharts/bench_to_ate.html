<p>This gives an overview of the high level architecture for controlling ATE from Bench EVK Software. The architecture does not fundamentally change, but throughput is increased.</p>

<h1 id="general-notes">General Notes</h1>
<p>Note Link-Scale is capable of a 20MHz clock with an effective throughput of 15Mbps. The throughput does not take into account any overhead of the protocol and is the wire throughput.</p>
<p>The PS1600https://marvell.zoom.us/j/98134566431?pwd=YWJHb2lEaUZwakZtc0o0UXlNakZsUT09 is implemented in a way that a reg_set/reg_get can be performed sequentially. The XMLRPC enables support for *_list which populates a list of addresses and data for performing the operation, the PS1600 implementation will do this sequentially which means there isn’t a savings or throughput increase. Link Scale’s architecture makes support of variable length transactions much more straightforwards, so a throughput bump is experienced by these commands.</p>
