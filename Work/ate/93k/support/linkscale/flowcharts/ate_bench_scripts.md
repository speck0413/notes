# Test Flow and TTM Comparison PS1600 vs Link Scale

# General Notes

Note Link-Scale is capable of a 20MHz clock with an effective throughput of 15Mbps. The throughput does not take into account any overhead of the protocol and is the wire throughput.

# Today's Bring-up Flow and Test Flow

Code must be converted from Python to C++ for ATE while still utilizing single-site API's generated by Design. The API's are sufficiently complicated that conversion is not necessarily feasible. The version described below is what would be released to production for decent MSE. The initial version would likely just serialize everything in one method, the below version has the Wait for Link Ready parallelized. The final phase would be to vectorize everything shaving off what the last inefficiencies, this must be done per firmware release, is difficult and likely will take multiple iterations to get delays perfected.

## Optimized Code

This code would be optimized once the test program is stable and we're in the TTR phase. A deep correlation is required at this step to make sure we didn't accidently break something. Additionally if the program wasn't written with this in mind from the beginning, there is a chance a bug could be introduced at this step.

# Proposed flow using Link Scale

The code does not need to go through any conversion step, it will work natively on Link Scale. Furthermore the code can be validated on the bench, even the controller (FT2232H chip) can be used to control an EVK removing more potential issues.

## For below example, quad site will be assumed

This code is the same whether 1 or 4 sites, there is no need to rework any code. What the below diagram is showing is we've kicked off the test case 4 times so each one runs in parallel. This means we write single site code and it can run in parallel efficiently. Link Scale is about 14x faster than PS1600 (100uS vs 1.4mS) per transaction, however a bulk of our time is spent waiting on the DUT. This fully parallelizes waits including nested or deeply buried waits we previously had to Vectorize.

The savings will not be as good as Vectorizing the entire flow, but we can get the savings much earlier in the process with less headache and correlation required. Additionally it enables the use of Python or C++ for the test cases with little to no difference in overhead.
