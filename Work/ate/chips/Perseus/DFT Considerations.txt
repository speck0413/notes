Mirror Spica+ Firmware Interaction architecture
    Write arguments to fixed location
    Write "GO" bit at fixed register
    Wait for "DONE" bit at fixed register

    examples
        firmware download
        INIT + ENTER_OP for DUAL PRBS 53G
        test BER
        then INIT + ENTER_OP EGRESS 56G
        test BER

    can 
package id bumps instead of fuses?
